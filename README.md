# Research-Gaining-a-Foothold

Over the summer of 2022 I, along with 3 other students, took part in research as a part of
the MOSTEC program with PhD candidate Peter Godart regarding proposals on possible methods
of preventing the alarming issue of climate change. We utilized MATLAB and data analysis
to create a model and report on the possibility of reconstructing cities to be less reliant
on carbon-emitting vehicles. The abstract, along with the links to the report and models 
can be found below.

ABSTRACT:
The average motorist emits 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year, but as climate change worsens, 
the number of people who rely on a carbon-emitting vehicle grows. But what if we took a 
different approach to the problem? Societies are built in such a way that citizens must 
rely on automobiles to get around. What if we rebuilt environments in such a way that people 
do not have to rely on carbon emitting vehicles? Reconstructing cities to make them more 
walkable is an idea that would reduce the number of cars on the road while also making 
transportation more convenient for people all over the world. We discuss the viability of this 
solution and what steps could be taken in the future to make an impactful difference.
